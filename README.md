LoanInterestRateChallenge

Step 1:
Clean and prepare your data: There are several entries where values have been deleted to simulate dirty data. Please clean the data with whatever method(s) you believe is best/most suitable. Note that some of the missing values are truly blank (unknown answers) and thus may be impossible to clean; use your discretion.

Step 2:
Build your models: Please build two distinctly different machine learning/statistical models in Python to predict the interest rate assigned to a loan.
